Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is a branch of both computer science and engineering focused on designing, developing, testing and maintaining of software applications
  It is important in the modern technological landscape as it provides the methodologies and principles required to develop, maintain and manage software systems efficiently.
  Here are the key aspects of its importance:
    .Structured Development Processes
    .Quality and Maintenance
    .Problem-Solving and Innovation
    .Security and Performance
    .Collaboration and Communication


2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  Milestones include: 
   (i) The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C) 
   (ii) The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
   Software engineering emerged as a formal discipline in response to the "Software Crisis"—a period when large-scale projects faced delays, high costs, and failures due to a lack of structured development processes.
   (iii) The advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.
   Structured Programming (1970s) – Introduction of concepts to improve code readability and maintainability. Key figures like Edsger Dijkstra promoted structured programming as a way to reduce errors and enhance efficiency.
   Agile Methodologies (2000s) – Agile development, formalized in the Agile Manifesto (2001), emphasized iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility over rigid, document-heavy processes. Agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban revolutionized software development by enabling faster delivery and continuous improvement.


3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

  
4.Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  - Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall. It could be used in government and regulatory Projects since they require strict documentation and compliance (e.g., defense, healthcare systems).
  - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. It is appropriate to use in startups and product development Where frequent iterations and customer feedback drive innovation (e.g., mobile apps, SaaS platforms).


5.Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software Developers. They are responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineers. They ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Managers oversee the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

6.Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


7.What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


8.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
